Multiple tests for NeuralProphet model on principal components 

total_pca: no climatology performed, split train/test data before PCA

large_pca: 10 principal components

pca_test: climatology data with standard scaler

pca_test2: climatology data - not scaled, tested with temperature only as well

totalpca_test: no climatology performed

samepca_temp: pca fit on temp data and applied to temp and aod

samepca_aod: pca fit on aod data and applied to temp and aod
